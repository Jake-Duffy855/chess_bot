###java_search
- added call to jar to run search faster
- merged into main :)

###better_in_check
- modifying is_in_check code to make search faster
- starting by modifying python code
- add dict {piece: [pos]}
  - instead of searching board for checking pieces, look at map to see if there's possibly a checking piece
